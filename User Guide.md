# **Parser**

## Testing

1. Run "make" in the command line
2. In the *inputs/* folder, edit the file *string.txt* to the string you want to parse and the file *symbols.txt* for the characters you want to parse the string at (**Note:** if a newline character is the last character in the text file, that newline character will be ignored)
3. Run "bin/test" in the command line
4. Once testing is finished, run "make clean"

## How It Works
**Note:** The actual parser files consist of the files *parser.h* and *parser.cpp*. All other files (*test.cpp*, *string.txt*, *symbols.txt*) are for testing purposes only. The documentation of the parser from here on will only refer to the files *parser.h* and *parser.cpp*.
